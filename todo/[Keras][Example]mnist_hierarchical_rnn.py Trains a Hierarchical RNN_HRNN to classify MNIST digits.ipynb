    "HRNNs can learn across multiple levels\n",
    "of temporal hierarchy over a complex sequence.\n",
    "Usually, the first recurrent layer of an HRNN\n",
    "encodes a sentence (e.g. of word vectors)\n",
    "into a  sentence vector.\n",
    "The second recurrent layer then encodes a sequence of\n",
    "such vectors (encoded by the first layer) into a document vector.\n",
    "This document vector is considered to preserve both\n",
